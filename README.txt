INTRO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am RokoKing20, the creator of the respritory you justed downloaded. Cool, right?
	This is my first repository so don't be that hard on me, ok? But still feedback
	would be much appreciated, just don't criticize too hard.

THIS RESPRITORY----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, I would like to establishe a few ground rules here, first of all you are free to 
	update this repository and make mods of it and also you can make a better version
	of the game. You are free to do that, but you can't claim the original version (this version)
	as yours. Other than that, good luck on playing the game and have fun playing it and 
	making mods for it, if you dare- I mean wish.
